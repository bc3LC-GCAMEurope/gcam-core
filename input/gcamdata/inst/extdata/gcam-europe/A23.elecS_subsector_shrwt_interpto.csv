# Title: Multiple Load Segments Subsector Shareweights
# Units: unitless
# Comments: Subsector shareweights for subsectors that are not fixed at calibration values. 
# These subsectors need a to-value which specifies the value to which the shareweight is being interpolated.
# Supplysector set to either segment or "electricity" to apply to all segments not listed
# Column types: cccccic
