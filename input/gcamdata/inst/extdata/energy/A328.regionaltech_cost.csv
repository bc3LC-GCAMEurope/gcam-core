# Title: Food processing default regional costs
# Units: 1975$/Mcal for supplysector food processing
# Source: Estimated from Global Trade Analysis Project data for household and government expenditures on processed food; see CMP and accompanying scripts for how these were calculated. By default any region not specified in this file will use the global value (which is the weighted average of regional values); if a new region is added and a regionally-specific value is desired it must be added to this file
