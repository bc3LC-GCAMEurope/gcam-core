# File: A22.SubsectorInterp_en_R.csv
# Title: Region-specific refining subsector shareweights interpolation rules 
# Descreption: adjust biomass liquid share weight for few regions with palm biodiesel to lower values. This is needed due to data update.
# Units: Unitless share-weights
# Date of last update: 2024-02-26 (XZ)
# Comment:note that for regions not included (e.g. new regions) USA assumptions are used by default. Currently, the same assumption is used across all regions, e.g., same with A22.subsector_interp.csv
# Column types: ccccnnc
