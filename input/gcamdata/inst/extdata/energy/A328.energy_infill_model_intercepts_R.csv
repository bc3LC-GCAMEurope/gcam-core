# Title: Food processing energy use infilling model intercepts
# Description: Intercepts from the derived linear model relating food processing energy use to GDP and non-staples calorie consumption on a GCAM region level. Value listed for region=default is the default value used for regions that were not employed in model-fitting and that will also be used for any new regions not specified in this file
# Units: Listed in file
# Source: Derived from FAO food consumption data and IEA energy use data on a GCAM region level
# Column types: ncnc
